## üöÄ Project Overview & Architecture

This app provides an interactive web interface for users to generate custom home design plans using generative AI. It supports multiple user scenarios (real estate, renovation, architecture), room-by-room customization, and visual inspiration via Unsplash images.

**Main Components:**
- **`app.py`**: Main Streamlit app, UI, and logic.
- **Google Gemini API**: Generates design plans based on user input.
- **Unsplash API**: Fetches relevant home design images.
- **Session State**: Caches results and manages dynamic room forms.
- **Requirements**: See `requirements.txt` for all dependencies.

**Extensibility:**
- Add new design styles by updating the `style_images` dictionary in `app.py`.
- Integrate other AI models by modifying the `generate_design_idea` function.
- Add new amenities or room types by editing the relevant lists in the UI section.
